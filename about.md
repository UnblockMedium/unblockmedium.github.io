### TL;DR

The Malaysian Government, Malaysian Communications And Multimedia Commission (MCMC) blocked the blog-publishing platform <a href="https://medium.com/about/about-medium-9eac453da935" target="_blank">Medium</a> solely because of this one article/report titled "<a href="https://medium.com/@sarawakreport/najib-negotiates-his-exit-but-he-wants-safe-passage-and-all-the-money-exclusive-disclosure-8d7d44343b50#.br6lvkxwl" target="_blank">Najib Negotiates His Exit BUT He Wants Safe Passage AND All The Money! EXCLUSIVE DISCLOSURE</a>" (in regards to the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak) published by a UK-based Whistleblower Sarawak Report founded by Clare Rewcastle Brown. 

Malaysian Communications And Multimedia Commission (MCMC) contacted Medium.com for a take-down request on very article. The Medium Legal team responded with <a href="https://medium.com/medium-legal/the-post-stays-up-d222e34cb7e7" target="_blank">The Post Stays Up</a>

> We stand by investigative journalists who publish on Medium. Until we receive an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, the post stays up. &mdash; Medium Legal

### About 

We decided to make a short, simplified 'reporting' (of some kind) on this issue. We are in no way part of Medium. We are against any type of Internet Censorship.

- - - 

### Purpose

For reporting purposes. We have no malicious or crude intend really. We report what we visually see and physically read on the Internet and provide a link back to the actual source and provide credit to the individual (giving credit where credit is due). 

We speak on behalf of all Netizens (Internet Citizens), we would like the Malaysian Government, Malaysian Communications And Multimedia Commission (MCMC) specifically to unblock Medium.com as soon as possible &mdash; they should not be censoring the Internet in such a manner; what more a blog-publishing platform such as Medium.com site-wide &mdash; which is used by many startups, computer geeks, politicians (why including POTUS Barack Obama) and even Whistleblowers (whoops!).

Medium.com has a ton of productive articles of various topics written by diverse writers and professional journalists.

Putting a barrier on Information or Knowledge is never a wise move. Bluntly said.

### Social Media

We are on Twitter <a href="//twitter.com/UnblockMedium" target="_blank">@UnblockMedium</a> and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UnblockMedium/" target="_blank">Unblock Medium</a> Community on Facebook &mdash; moderated by eager Malaysian citizens who want to do a little something to get Medium.com unblocked. Godspeed.
